    such information. You also may choose to have the personal information you supply on your My 

    Account page viewable to Fast2Find users in general. Users and/or guests invited to the same

communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and 
disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure 
email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website for information about how to protect 
yourself against identity theft and/or the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and Federal
